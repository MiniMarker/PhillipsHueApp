This is a weekend project where i use the Philips Hue API to control all the connected light bulbs for a bridge.

When you run this program you will get promoted by a Terminal GUI with options to control the lighting in your system.

Following functionalities are supported

* Brightness control with microphone input
* Color control (presets and custom)

## How to run the code
1. Open the project in your IDE (I've been developed this program in IntelliJ)
2. Run the main class
